Data analysis and classification play a huge role in understanding various real life phenomena. Clustering helps in analyzing data with little or no prior knowledge about it. K-means clustering is a popular clustering algorithm with applications in Computer Vision, Data Mining, Data Visualization, etc. Due to continuously increasing data volume parallel computing is necessary to overcome the computational challenges involved in K-means clustering. We present the design and implementation of K-means clustering algorithm on widely available Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), which have the required hardware architecture to meet these parallelism needs. We analyze the scalability of our proposed methods with increase in number and dimensionality of data points as well as the number of clusters. Our implementations are able to achieve throughput very close to the theoretical peak rates of the NVIDIA GPUs. We also compare our results with current best available implementations on GPUs and 24-way threaded parallel CPU implementations. We were able achieve a consistent speedup of 6.5x over the parallel CPU implementation.
