I am greatly indebted to my supervisor Prof. Mainak Chaudhuri for his encouragement, patience and expert advice throughout the course of my study at IIT Kanpur. In spite of his busy schedule, he has always been there to help me and provide me his invaluable technical guidance and moral support. He always gave me the right direction to focus on. 

Special thanks to all my classmates of the MTech'10 batch of the Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Kanpur for their constructive criticism of my work and for helping me out with various issues during the study. 
I especially thank Ajith Sankar for offering intuitive ideas and brain storming sessions.

My family is my source of inspiration and this thesis would have been incomplete without their support. It is my father Mr Vijay Kumar Aggarwal and my mother Mrs Sunita Aggarwal's endurance and patience that kept me motivated at all times. I could not have been successful without the never ending support from my brother Abhishek Aggarwal and my sister Sugandha Aggarwal. Finally, I would once again like to thank all my friends for insightful discussions, suggestions and encouragement.
